# bbkt-reg.jl

This registry allows one to bring in one's bitbucket.org packages without having
to reference the URL.  To add the registry to your Julia installation, 

```
pkg> registry add https://github.com/lootie/bbkt-reg.jl
```

This registry is forked from JuliaRegistries/Test (thank you!) and modified so
that my unregistered packages are included.
